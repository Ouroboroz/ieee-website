	<h2>Housing</h2>

	<p>Any student who is registered for the conference can get housing free of charge, for any of the nights of Nov 4, Nov 5, and Nov 6. MIT students have volunteered to host conference attendees in their dorms, and all hosts will be equipped with an air mattress to make the stay as comfortable as possible. If you are a student and would like to get housing in an MIT dorm, please fill out <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/we5wpDZ9tt">this form</a> and we'll match you with a host.</p>
