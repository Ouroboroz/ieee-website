            <b>Katrina LaCurts</b> <a href="abstracts.php#lacurts">(speaker abstract)</a> is a lecturer in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science department at MIT.  She received her PhD in computer science from MIT in 2014.  Her PhD research revolved around network measurement and using measurement data to make client applications for cloud-computing infrastructures and datacenters network-aware in order to improve performance.  As a lecturer, Dr. LaCurts is responsible for teaching courses that span many topics in computer systems: information theory, signal processing, operating systems, networking, security, etc.  Despite this breadth, she is able to talk about her favorite thing &dash; the Voyager program &dash; at least once in every course that she teaches.
