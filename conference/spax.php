		<h3>Activity Descriptions:</h3>
		<p><b>Networking Game:</b> Two truths and a lie: break into groups of 3-5 people, go around say two truths and a lie, rest of the group guesses what the lie is.</p>
		<p><b>Krenar-related Game, Make it Move:</b> Each team is given '$100'. There exists a general store that is stocked with the various supplies from above. The group must build something that moves forward. Whichever group makes it move the farthest wins.</p>
		<p><b>Jignasa-related Game, Adapt And Communicate:</b> 5-10 people are “characters”. Each “character” goes up to a group and negotiates. The goal is to adapt to the style of the individual. The idea of this game is to apply the emotional intelligence discussed by Jignasa to a negotiation type situation. For example, we could have someone representing a reserved culture. The person participating in the discussion is expected to adapt to the reserved persona portrayed by the individual.</p>
