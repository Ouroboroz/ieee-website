		<p class="title"><b>Wireless Ultrasonic Leak Detection for International Space Station -</b> <i class="name">Professor Ali Abedi</i></p>
		<p>

Air leaks in pressurized structures such as space vehicles or habitats due to micrometeorite

impacts or structural aging and failure are inevitable. Due to the large pressure differential

between interior of the module and space outside, the escaping air emits an ultrasonic wave

inside the module that may be detected using ultrasonic sensors. This presentation describes

hardware, software, and algorithmic challenges for localizing leaks using an array of ultrasonic

sensors. A major challenge with leak localization is inaccuracy due to reflections and noise.

With the use of Kalman filtering, tree-search algorithm, and a hyperbolic angle of arrival

algorithm, we can eliminate many of these inaccuracies. Design considerations for a standalone

device with its own battery power source, on-board processing, crew interfaces, signal-

conditioning circuitry, and a custom 3-D printed box are discussed in this presentation. Three

devices were built, flight certified and scheduled to deploy to the ISS for data collection during

the Fall of 2016. This project was funded through a three year NASA EPSCoR grant in

collaboration with the Office of ISS Technology Demonstration Programs.</p>

		<p class="title"><b>Agile Unmanned Vehicles (Drones) and Bioinspired Vision Sensors -</b> <i class="name">Professor George Giakos</i></p>
		<p>
The goal of this presentation is to introduce the technical challenges associated with the design and operational capabilities of autonomous navigation vision systems, then introduce sensing principles and techniques, borrowed from biological sensory response systems, overcoming these challenges. Computer vision has a center role in unmanned aerial vehicles, for a number of tasks like s-localization, navigation, target recognition and tracking. A major challenge in the design of autonomous navigtaion systems is the processing of the visual information. As a result, the operation of such systems in urban settings is limited by their competing design requirements leading to reduced agility. The above challenges can be mitigated by means of bioinspired vision principles. Bioinspired computer vision is promising towards building adaptive computer vision systems with enhanced agility. Invertebrates, such as insects, as well as some crustaceans, such as the mantis shrimp, have compound eyes. The advantages of the compound eyes consist on their superb wide viewing angle and the fast movement tracking due to the large amount of photoreceptor units that do not have to individually move to track, and the ability to detect polarized light. In addition, certain animals, exhibit unique navigation capabilities, because of their homing behaviors, i.e., their ability to return home by using visual ques. The enhanced polarization vision capabilities of certain animals, combined with a wide field-of- view, fast tracking, multi-functional eye structure, and homing, add agility to the design of drones, while providing enhanced structural, localization, navigation, and tracking capabilities. As result, bioinspired vision principles can be applied not only towards the design of autonomous navigation systems, but also to the design of efficient biomedical systems for early diagnosis of cancer, and enhanced detection and identification of tissue pathologies, because of their polarization sensitivity.

		<p class="title"><b>Algorithmic Data Science = Theory + Practice -</b> <i class="name">Matteo Riondato</i></p>
		<p>
Obtaining actionable insights from large datasets requires the use methods that must be, at once, fast, scalable, and statistically sound. This is the field of study of algorithmic data science, a discipline at the border of computer science and statistics. In this talk I outline the fundamental questions that motivate research in this area, present a general framework to formulate many problems in this field, introduce the challenges in balancing theoretical and statistical correctness with practical efficiency, and I show how sampling-based algorithms are extremely effective at striking the correct balance in many situations, giving examples from social network analysis and pattern mining. I will conclude with some research directions and areas for future explorations.</p>

		<p class="title"><b>Importance of Scientific Research -</b> <i class="name">Katrina LaCurts</i></p>
		<p>
 Scientific research is hugely important -- it's where we discover the answers to previously unanswered questions, how we build new technologies, and in general how we make progress in our field.  But not everyone who does research as a undergraduate or graduate student ends up with a job in research.  What good is doing research if you don't pursue it as a career?  In this talk, Dr. LaCurts will cover her journey through research -- which sometimes went very well, and sometimes was a disaster -- and explain how she has been able to use her research skills in her decidedly non-research-oriented teaching career.</p>
